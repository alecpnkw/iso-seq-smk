# Currently, the default memory in the lsf profile
# is what defines the amount of memory per node. 
# Even though the values here are passed to the cluster
# command, they do not seem to have an effect. Instead, 
# define the required memory/threads using the `mem_mb`
# and `threads` for each rule in the snakefile. The 
# other options seem to be working.
